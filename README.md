# Customer Marketing Segmentation

**Task:** We are currently working for the marketing department of a mall and have received data of the employees of the mall; this includes their salary and how much money they spend at the mall due to staff discount. To increase subsidies further, we are tasked to cluster employees into segments so we can enroll each segment into a tailored loyalty scheme that better meets their requirements.

We will be completing a business task using clustering: K-Means and Hierarchical

## K-Means Clustering

**Pros of K-Means Clustering**

- Simple to understand
- Easily adaptable
- Works well on small or large datasets
- Fast, efficient and performant

**Cons of K-Means Clustering**

- Need to choose the number of clusters
